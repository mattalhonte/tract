/// # Operators on array and shapes
///
/// ## "Valid" reshaping operators
///
/// ### Both ONNX and TF
///
/// * Squeeze, unary (with or without an axis list, and... TF consider the empty list as
/// an absent list)
/// * Reshape, binary (input, shape as a tensor)
///
/// ### ONNX only
///
/// * Unsqueeze, unary, with required list of axes (referring to output)
/// * (Expand is a broadcasting operators, it does not beling here)
///
/// ### TF Only
///
/// * ExpandDims, binary (input, axis list)
///
/// ### Ours
///
/// * AddDims, just like ONNX's unsqueeze (Unsqueeze actually instantiate AddDims)
/// * RmDims, like Squeeze but with a mandatory axis list as an attribute.
///     Squeeze can always reduce to RmDims after inference.
///
/// ## Slicing and Upsampling
///
/// ### TF
///
/// * StridedSlice does everything
///
/// ### ONNX
///
/// * [Slice](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#Slice),
///     unary, attr are: begins, ends, and optional axes remapping them
/// * [Upsample](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#Upsample),
///     unary, attrs are scales (floats) and mode of interpolation (nearest or
///     linear). not impl.
/// * DynamicSlice, experimental, not impl
///
/// ### Ours
///
/// * Slice, unary, mandatory attrs are begin and end.
